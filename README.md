# 01-Measuring-Game-Engine-Performance
## Introduction
In this module we will dicuss many ways to optimise, but you need to be able to monitor if your optimisations are actually providing performance benefits.

This week, we are looking into measuring the performance of a game engine. We will learn some techniques for optimising some demo projects I have developed. For simplicity, we will do this inside the Unity game engine without altering the game engine code, but these techniques can be hard-coded into any game engine you develop. We will profile in Unity too, which provides a nice looking and in-depth profiling tool, but you can profile in any game engine you develop also once you understand the simple concept of the 'performance budget'. Hopefully this is a gentle start to the module where you will be introduced to measuring performance and a new way of thinking about how to optimise/tune a game engine.

## Summary
- Understand 'performance budget'.
- Understand how to use the Unity Profiler to be able to understand the game engine operations behind-the-scenes.
- Learn some general techniques for tuning a game engine to introduce you to a new way of thinking (how could this be optimised?) and comparing the performance before and after optimisation.

## Tutorial
1. Open up project 1 in Unity and work through **01 - The Unity Profiler Introduction.md**.
2. Work through **02 - Time Slicing.md**.
3. Work through **03 - Optimisation Task.md**.
4. If there's any extra time, feel free to profile any Unity projects of your own if you have any.
